\subsubsection{System Perspective}

afetbilgi.com \cite{afetbilgi} is not a part of a larger system. It is a standalone and open source efforted website to verify important information in the fight against the 6 February 2023 Pazarcik Earthquake and to deliver it to both disaster victims and those who want to help in an understandable, concise manner in multiple languages.

This information is presented in either the form of legible tables with 3rd party governmental and private links or an interactable method via a map view interface. If deemed necessary, admin and maintainers can make changes to display newly created or edited data and upload it to the system upon any complains or suggestion they may get on their contact details.
