\subsection{Usability Requirements}

% Checked in grammarly
\begin{itemize}
    \item Being a website, users shall be able to easily navigate fast to sections concerning their relevant interest via clearly labeled explicitly placed buttons on the page.
    \item Users shall be able to understand the hierarchical/efficiently categorized portions of this website in the form of help categories and city selection.
    \item The website has been made easy to follow in multiple languages and has a simple plain design with center-placed buttons and efficient answering tables of information.
    \item Site maintainers have made the contents of this website accessible to the public, governmental organizations, media outlets, and sponsors/volunteers alike, in addition to its target of earthquake victims.
    \item The website has been optimized to work correctly on mobile devices and ensure access from anywhere.
    \item The website has contact details and socials of its managing community's details for fast feedback regarding complaints, and reviews from its users.
    \item Users must be able to gain fast access to pdf generation for distribution given stressful, emergency conditions in earthquake-stricken areas.
    \item Site maintainers must have verified as much information on details as possible for users to access while safeguarding their monetary and physical interests.
    \item Users shall be able to access the website at all times for secure third-party links. Hence the site maintainer's agenda is to host on widely-acclaimed services like Cloudflare.
    \item Maps should be able to serve not just geo-locations but also internal details, such as contact details involving physical addresses and phone numbers on description boxes for easy accessibility by victims and helper volunteers alike.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Requirements}

% Checked in grammarly
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High Availability:} To guarantee that it is always accessible, particularly in times of emergency when people require information and support, the \afetbilgi website should have high availability.
    \item \textbf{Fast Loading:} The website must load rapidly for users to access the required data immediately, especially in locations with sluggish internet connectivity. The site's various DNS(s)' health is regularly checked with CI/CD workflows.
    \item \textbf{Backup site data:} Via the backend of the GitHub workflow, the website is backed up and updated every 30 minutes with the latest version visible on any viewed webpage(from the site's hierarchy).
    \item \textbf{Adaptability:} The website has an adaptable design with straightforward, strategically positioned buttons suitable for desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} The backend of the Cloudflare website should be able to handle high traffic, especially in times of emergency when it may increase dramatically.User-Friendly Interface: The website should have a simple, user-friendly interface that makes it simple for visitors to access available resources and obtain the information they need.
    \item \textbf{Multilingual Support:} To allow users who do not speak their native language to access the website's resources and information, the site maintainers have built it such that the website should support multiple languages.
    \item \textbf{Social media integration:} To encourage communication and information sharing among the impacted communities and other stakeholders, the website has been integrated with social media platforms like Discord and Twitter.
    \item \textbf{Accessibility:} \afetbilgi was created with accessibility in mind to make sure that persons with impairments can access the data and tools offered on the website, like different map views.
    \item \textbf{Information that is accurate and current:} \afetbilgi makes every attempt to offer accurate and current information regarding the earthquake, its effects, and the ongoing relief efforts.
    \item \textbf{Security and privacy:} To safeguard user personal information and guarantee that their donations and contributions are secure and free from frauds or thefts, third-party, external links with security and privacy in mind are chosen on the \afetbilgi website.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Logical Database Requirements}

\afetbilgi does not currently have any relational database. To acquire the required data for both site and maps, it gets a JSON file from AWS and the code of website parses this JSON file according the path and the chosen option. For this purpose, it uses axios to send \texttt{GET} request to the \href{https://cdn.afetbilgi.com/latest.json}{\texttt{cdn.afetbilgi.com/latest.json}}. This request returns the \texttt{latest.json} file, which includes all the data required in the website. Although it may have drawback such as long load time, it may have advantages such as not loading any data after initial load.

To parse and upload the JSON file into the AWS, Github Workflows are used. Github Workflows parse and upload the \texttt{latest.json} by using the data, which collectors and validators collect and validate, periodically.

The relations between objects in the JSON file is shown at Figure \addnumbertofigure{1}. The code use these relations to parse the JSON correctly and show the included information in the JSON. If the system is updated to a relational database, the database can use the relations at the Figure \addnumbertofigure{1}.

\subsection{Design Constraints}

% Checked in grammarly
The \afetbilgi website uses minimalistic design on its frontend site with central-placed, bold text clear buttons to allow users under potentially distressing conditions to scout and navigate through. Not only that, but due to a lack of proper open license given how the website was created for urgent use by students, the website still employs a proper backend system, at least, with Cloudflare to handle proxy DNS issues, GitHub CI/CD workflows to continuous update the website and check the various DNS(s) health, along with AWS to hold backup versions in cloud bucket instances too.
