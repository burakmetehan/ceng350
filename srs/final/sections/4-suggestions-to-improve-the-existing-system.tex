\section{Suggestions to Improve the Existing System}

\subsection{System Perspective}

% Checked in grammarly
\afetbilgi\ is not part of a more extensive system. It is a standalone and open-source efforted website to verify critical information in the fight against the 6 February 2023 Pazarcik Earthquake and deliver it to disaster victims and those who want to help in an understandable, concise manner in multiple languages.

This information is presented in either the form of legible tables with third-party governmental and private links or an interactable method via a map view interface. If deemed necessary, admin and maintainers can make changes to display newly created or edited data and upload it to the system upon any complaints or suggestions they may get on their contact details.

\newpage

The \afetbilgi\ consists of a combination of small physical and software parts. With the help of interfaces, these parts communicate among themselves and with the user. The following are the interfaces through which interaction occurs:
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{1pt}
  \item User interfaces
  \item Software interfaces
  \item Communication interfaces
\end{itemize}
Users interact with the website through their devices connected to the internet, such as cell phones or computers, as the user interface. The software interface enables the website to serve additional features to the user.

\subsubsection{User Interfaces}

In order to start using the website, a user should go into the website via a device connected to the internet. The website may have some loading time. After loading, the website is ready for user interactions. Users can interact with \afetbilgi\ directly to access required information.

The user interface contains \href{https://mui.com/}{MUI} components which are clear buttons and lists. Users can interact with the buttons to access the list of information or access more options related to the chosen information type.

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}

\afetbilgi\ runs mainly JavaScript code with React library. It also uses additional react libraries such as \href{https://mui.com/}{MUI}.

The website makes necessary request to use some features such as accessing Google API, social media APIs and mail service.

\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}

Since \afetbilgi\ is a website, it communicates via HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) and underlying protocols such as TCP/IP. It uses HTTPS to access APIs and servers.

\subsection{Usability Requirements}

% Checked in grammarly
\begin{itemize}
  \item Users shall be able to register for the website with proper verification to avoid while also avoiding any potential discrimination.
  \item Users shall be able to add their identity details as they see fit while upholding their privacy and verifying their accounts for site maintainers to approve.
  \item Site maintainers shall allow users to prioritize alerts as per their subscription settings.
  \item Any new entries or reviews of existing entries shall have tickets reviewed before being approved for publication on the website.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Requirements}

% Checked in grammarly
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Privacy:} User account information has to be verified and safeguarded with a capable authentication service inclusive of AWS's IAM (Identity and Access Management) service.
  Security: Accounts must be verified with proper mechanisms such as sms and email verification to avoid scams/frauds.
  \item \textbf{Scalability:} Tickets for new data entries or reviews for existing ones must be reviewed fast by the site's team employing our proposed relational database system to track ticket ids and classify them as approved or not.
  \item \textbf{Social Media Integration:} Sharing data entries to external social media apps shall have prepared to post templates to save time(such as a Story template for Facebook and Instagram).
  \item \textbf{Accurate and current information:} \afetbilgi\ makes a new attempt to offer the best data entries, which have now been reviewed under a new scale of trust by users who can evaluate/offer feedback for entries.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Logical Database Requirements}

\afetbilgi\ does currently have a relational database. To make minor difference in the source code, the object structure in the Section 3.5 is preserved. Additionally, users, roles and mail subscription data are added into database. \texttt{Users} relation provides information related to the login system. \texttt{Roles} relation provides information related to the registered role. \texttt{Mail Subscription} relation provides the information related to topics that users subcribed. \texttt{SiteInformation} relation provides information related to the information located in the website.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/database-s4.jpg}
  \caption{Suggested New Relational Database}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Design Constraints}

% Checked in grammarly
The new features of afetbilgi do need more processing times from users, especially those requiring immediate information in a tense, urgent situation such as regarding a nearby hospital. 

With that in mind, additional improvements such Login/Register procedure could be made optional in case of simply reading data without any input from the user in the form of feedback for current data entries and adding input for new ones. On the other hand, though, improving communication in the form of sharing directly to personal socials and attaining email alerts for updates is also crucial to help users spread reliable intel fast and securely.

\subsection{System Attributes}

% Checked in grammarly
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Reliability:}
    \begin{itemize}[label=$\blacksquare$]
      \item A new open-source license (quoted in the repositories’ manual) would allow for more fair use by future contributors reliably.
      \item A more concretely established regulation policy and other plain Github workflows would help in continuous integration and development while keeping website health at best, such as via Jenkins/DevOps mechanisms integration.
      \item An audit mechanism has been introduced that allows the website entries to be viewed by human personnel in addition to automated Github workflows.
      \item Newly added feedback/data entries must be checked with human contributors to make them sensible and correspond to established data node interface conventions.
    \end{itemize}

  \vspace*{\fill}
  \newpage

  \item \textbf{Security and Privacy:}
    \begin{itemize}[label=$\blacksquare$]
      \item The login and Registration service ensures that users are verified before they can contribute to the website.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Portability:}
    \begin{itemize}[label=$\blacksquare$]
      \item Users can share on their socials and even receive email and alerts via subscription to the website.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Supporting Information}

% Checked in grammarly
The website can be kept life for a couple of years or indefinitely with permanent government funding if needed by at least the Turkish government's own AFAD (disaster management) authority.

Precious information such as user details/data entries will always be protected under privacy laws under this supported website agreement with the government until site maintainers retire the site.
