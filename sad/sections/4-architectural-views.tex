\afetbilgi \cite{afetbilgi} is not part of a more extensive system. It is a standalone and open-source efforted website to verify critical information in the fight against the 6 February 2023 Pazarcik Earthquake and deliver it to disaster victims and those who want to help in an understandable, concise manner in multiple languages.

This information is presented in either the form of legible tables with third-party governmental and private links or an interactable method via a map view interface. If deemed necessary, admin and maintainers can make changes to display newly created or edited data and upload it to the system upon any complaints or suggestions they may get on their contact details.
